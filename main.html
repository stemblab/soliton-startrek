<h2> Star Trek's solitons are real </h2>

    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge Geordi La Forge] was right: 
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton solitons] *are* exciting---no matter 
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BQT_iXVL28 what his colleagues may think].

    A soliton is a pulse that experiences both nonlinearity and
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(water_waves)
    dispersion].  Nonlinearity sharpens the pulse---taller parts
    travel faster than shorter parts (like a wave breaking on a
    beach). Dispersion spreads it out---different frequencies travel
    at different speeds. With a soliton the sharpening and spreading
    balance *exactly* (and the balance is stable!).

    Not that long ago the very idea that such order could exist in a
    nonlinear system was
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi-Pasta-Ulam_problem new and
    unexpected].  And the soliton has a further surprise.  When two
    (or more) solitons collide they interact nonlinearly, but
    eventually emerge unchanged. They appear to behave much like a
    particle (prot*on*, neutr*on* etc.).

    Solitons are a genuine wonder of the nonlinear world. Below you
    can experiment with solitons of the
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg-de_Vries_equation KdV]
    equation. Click in the box below to
    <span class="pz_text" ref="ic_note">initialize</span> the solitons
    and run the
    <span class="pz_text" ref="trefethen_note">simulation</span>.

    Tall solitons experience more nonlinearity and so are faster and
    narrower (for higher dispersion). Two solitons collide in
    <span class="pz_text" ref="lax_note">different ways</span> according
    to the ratio of their amplitudes.

    While we use numerical methods here, true solutions are available
    via the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_scattering_transform
    Inverse Scattering Transform].  The IST is a *nonlinear analog of
    the Fourier transform*, and one of the great advances of modern
    mathematical physics.

    Geordi was right: solitons are exciting---and perhaps just a little
    weird as well.

      It's best if the pulses aren't too close together. The collision
      of solitons is complex, and we haven't allowed for that with our
      simple initial condition.

      When the ratio is high the larger soliton appears to absorb and
      emit the smaller. But when the amplitudes are similar the
      solitons seem to change positiion. There is also a third, more
      subtle, regime as explored by
      [https://archive.org/details/integralsofnonli00laxp Lax].
